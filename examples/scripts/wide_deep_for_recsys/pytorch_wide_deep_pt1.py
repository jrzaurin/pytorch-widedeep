# The main difference between this wide and deep model and the Wide and Deep

# concatenates the embedings and the tabular features(which he refers
# as 'continuous'), then passes this concatenation through a stack of
# linear + Relu layers. Then concatenates this output with the binary
# features and connects this concatenation with the final linear layer. Our
# implementation follows the notation of the original paper and instead of
# concatenating the tabular, text and wide components, we first compute their
# output, and then add it (see here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf,
# their Eq 3). Note that this is effectively the same with the caveat that
# while in one case we initialise a big weight matrix at once, in our
# implementation we initialise different matrices for different components.
# Anyway, let's give it a go.
