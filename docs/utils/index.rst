The ``utils`` module
====================

These are a series of utilities that might be useful for a number of
preprocessing tasks, even not directly related to ``pytorch-widedeep``. All
the classes and functions discussed here are available directly from the
``utils`` module. For example, the ``LabelEncoder`` within the
``deeptabular_utils`` submodule can be imported as:

.. code-block:: python

	from pytorch_widedeep.utils import LabelEncoder
