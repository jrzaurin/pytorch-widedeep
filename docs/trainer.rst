Training multimodal Deep Learning Models
========================================

Here is the documentation for the ``Trainer`` class, that will do all the heavy lifting.

Trainer is also available from ``pytorch-widedeep`` directly, for example, one could do:

.. code-block:: python

	from pytorch-widedeep.training import Trainer


or also:

.. code-block:: python

	from pytorch-widedeep import Trainer


.. autoclass:: pytorch_widedeep.training.Trainer
