# Training multimodal Deep Learning Models

Here is the documentation for the ``Trainer`` class, that will do all the heavy lifting.

Trainer is also available from ``pytorch-widedeep`` directly, for example, one could do:

```
    from pytorch-widedeep.training import Trainer
```

or also:

```
    from pytorch-widedeep import Trainer
```

::: pytorch_widedeep.training.Trainer
    selection:
        filters:
            - "!^_"  # exclude all members starting with _
            - "!^get_embeddings$"
