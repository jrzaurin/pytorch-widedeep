# Training multimodal Deep Learning Models

Here is the documentation for the ``Trainer`` class, that will do all the heavy lifting.

Trainer is also available from ``pytorch-widedeep`` directly, for example, one could do:

```
	from pytorch-widedeep.training import Trainer
```

or also:

```
	from pytorch-widedeep import Trainer
```

::: pytorch_widedeep.training.Trainer
	<!-- selection:
		members:

			- predict
			- predict_uncertainty
			- predict_proba
			- get_embeddings -->
