# The ``utils`` module


These are a series of utilities that might be useful for a number of
preprocessing tasks, even not directly related to ``pytorch-widedeep``. All
the classes and functions discussed here are available directly from the
``utils`` module. For example, the ``LabelEncoder`` within the
``deeptabular_utils`` submodule can be imported as:

```
from pytorch_widedeep.utils import LabelEncoder
```

These are classes and functions that are internally used in the library. We
include them here in case the user finds them useful for other purposes.
